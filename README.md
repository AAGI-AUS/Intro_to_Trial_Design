# Introduction to Trial Design

An AAGI [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) slide deck built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) that covers basic experimental design for industry partners.

## Viewing and Presenting the Slides

Go [here]() and hit "S" for a separate window that will have the speaker notes so you can see what each slide covers in more detail.
Hit "F" on the main screen for a full-screen or select from the hamburger menu icon in the lower left corner of your screen.

## Modifying and Building

You will need [Quarto](https://quarto.org) installed locally to rebuild the slide deck but not to view or present the HTML slide deck.

Then, the `aagi_cu_trial_design.qmd` can be knit to create `aagi_cu_trial_design.html`.

[Playwright.py](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) was used to generate `aagi_cu_trial_design.pdf` for printed handouts via `render_pdf.py`.
